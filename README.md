# RegexTester-02082021

Performing Regex Test using Python Script

* Login public GITHUB
* Create repository 
* Create a branch called "onboarding"
* Create python file called _ regex_test.py
* Dowload the sample file attached to this task 
* Code the Python file so it reads the file and using regex it creates the following dictionary :


{code:java}
_interfaces = [
    {
    "name":"Ethernet1",
    "ip" : "172.168.1.1",
    "mask": "31",
    "description": "Spine-1-et1/1"
    },
    {
    "name": "Ethernet8/1",
    "ip" : "172.168.1.10",
    "mask": "31",
    "description": "ck428-et8/1",
    },
    {
    "name": "Loopback0",
    "ip" : "1.1.1.11",
    "mask": "32",
    "description": "",
    }
]

{code}

* When running the Python script the dictionary should be printed 
* the solution should work if more interfaces are added or deleted from the sample file
* Commit it to your repo, onboarding branch
